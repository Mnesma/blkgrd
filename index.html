                    <h1>I. What is a bossing mule and why make one?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Bossing mules are another name for an alternative character 
                        (not your main) that you use primarily as a way to kill bosses 
                        for mesos.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Are they efficient for mesos?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Not really, but it's a more detailed answer in practice. 
                        Farming on a character with max meso rate in the Arcane River 
                        will likely give you more bang for your buck, especially on a 
                        totem. But there are a few reasons why you might want to make a 
                        bossing mule instead:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You dislike farming or want to minimize it</li>
                        <li>You like bossing or want to do more of it</li>
                        <li>You find early progression fun!</li>
                        <li>
                            You want to try other classes, especially if you want to 
                            naturally invest in them (why not make them a bossing mule 
                            as well!)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Kanna's Kishin will be having its spawn boosting effect removed which
                            will reduce the efficiency of meso farming on Kanna. At the same time, 
                            future patches will be increasing the value of boss crystals anywhere 
                            from around 1.5x to 2x what they are now. That means that bossing 
                            crystals will become even more valuable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you are making a bossing mule with the intention of getting high 
                        returns then you should consider a different approach. It's not a very
                        efficient way to earn meso. This is especailly true so early on without 
                        legion/links/excess node stones. I recommend people make them if they want 
                        to boss more, make an alternative source of money, try a new class and/or
                        dislike farming.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Do I need high legion/links?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Both help tremendously. Someone with 8k legion will have a 
                        significantly easier time than someone with 2k legion for two primary 
                        reasons: Crit Rate and IED. Crit Rate remains difficult to obtain without 
                        some intentional investments hence why classes with high innate crit rate 
                        are skewed more favorably as bossing mules. A lack of IED, however, can be 
                        made up for by cubing for IED which I'll discuss later. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Do I need to invest a lot of mesos? Potential scrolls? Familiars? Nodes?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The answer is: it depends. It depends on whether you want to. If you 
                        are okay with distributing some potential gains from your main to your 
                        bossing mule, then go for it! There isn't a rule against it. Likely, it's 
                        at a point where the potential gains for your main are minimal so it's less 
                        a concern. If you're still growing your main and every node will be big for 
                        them, maybe hold off on any node transfers or a bossing mule at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It also depends on how fast you want to grow the bossing mule and how much 
                        stronger you need it to be. It's possible to start from 'scratch' (e.g. 
                        using legion/links/starting hyper teleport rock money/de minimis things) 
                        and hit 3-doors in 10 days or less if you know what to do and can play enough 
                        in that time. Throwing over 1B and 40 nodes, however, would make that process 
                        tremendously easier. Any leftover potential scrolls, mastercraft cubes, power 
                        elixirs, etc. just speed up your progression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, there is a 'sweet spot answer' where your investment helps a lot, 
                        but isn't too much. In my opinion: ~500 to 1B mesos, any nodes you can afford 
                        (20+), and the small things (regular potential scrolls, occults, power elixirs) 
                        make the whole process very smooth. But you can also progress without all this, 
                        so don't be discouraged (especially if you're a newer/returning player and 1B 
                        mesos or 20 nodes is not a small thing).
                    </p>
                    <h2>How much money can I make?</h2>
                    <p>
                        As you see in the chart below, the money you can make depends on how far you 
                        want to take your bossing mule. The 5x change will be happening this year as 
                        well. There is another change (dynamic crystal change) that will slightly nerf 
                        some of the lower weekly bosses' pricing, but this won't be a huge impact. For 
                        ease, I'll ignore that component here. Also consider other worthwhile dailies 
                        such as NMag or NArk.

                        As an example, in my (RAonDuty) experience, creating a 
                        character with a tera-burn and utilizing events, a 3-door 
                        bossing character can be made within 2b mesos.												
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In other words, ~5 weeks of 3-door bossing should recoup 
                        costs and will produce a profit!

                        Great, I'm interested - when should I make one and 
                        what class do I make?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        It depends - as always. You can make alts whenever you 
                        want, especially if you like making alts. But in terms of 
                        "efficiency," a good time is when your main hits a comfortable 
                        stop for arcane force (examples are 235 for all symbols 
                        unlocked, ~245 to potentially be in HLucid/HWill parties, 
                        250 for HWill parties, etc.). If you're still at, say, 224, 
                        you have lots of gain to just progress a bit further on your 
                        main. But again, if you want to take a break or a detour, the 
                        world is your proverbial oyster!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A good time to make one is during events (which can provide 
                        items, nodes, or make leveling easier) or during tera/mega-burns 
                        (which, similarly, make the process easier and provide nodes).

                    <p>
                        In terms of what class to make, the answer is always the same in 
                        theory: whichever one you enjoy! A class that is good but one you 
                        hate playing will be a chore, a burden, or a failed mule-in-the-making.

                    <p>
                        But, classes are relative to each other and some classes are just 
                        better suited for the bossing mule process (especially from a 
                        non-carry perspective). These classes often have, but not necessarily 
                        all:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Innate crit rate</li>
                        <li>Innate IED or not a high need for IED</li>
                        <li>Convenient iFrames and/or Dark Sight-type skills</li>
                        <li>Get a relatively higher boost from nodes or mesos invested</li>
                        <li>Just have a lot of innate skill power (so less reliant on boost nodes)</li>
                        <li>
                            Aren't as reliant on their Inner Ability (e.g. Attack Speed +1, 
                            Buff Duration) or Attack Speed 0 to feel good
                        </li>
                        <li>Have a class bind</li>

                        or a class you want to invest in, they deserve all the love,

                        a non-carry approach to equipment and progression.

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Level your bossing mule to 210/215/220+ (each set of five 
                            levels matter not necessarily for AF, which you don't really 
                            need, but for the extra node slot in your V-matrix. A sweet 
                            spot is 215, in my opinion).

                            Find your source of money - for some, that's transferring over 
                            money from your main. For others, it's self-contained on the 
                            character. To that extent, the source of money will come from:

                        <li>
                            Find familiars - try to at least get one familiar that gives 15% IED. 
                            This can be done by either using random cards you find OR transferring 
                            any familiars from other characters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Invest nodes into your character. The strategy varies on your class. 
                            Examples include:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Classes with a single boost node (e.g. Dawn Warrior)</li>
                                <li>Classes with strong V skills (e.g. Dual Blade, Hayato)</li>
                                <li>
                                    Classes with many boost nodes, but one bossing node 
                                    (e.g. Ark, forcing you to decide between long term boost 
                                    gain and just bossing mule boost gain)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Classes with multiple bossing nodes (e.g. Kain, making 
                                    it difficult to maximize node gains)
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        By the end, you should have a character that looks something like 
                        that for a relatively cheap investment (consider less than 3B + ~40 nodes at 
                        most, can get away with less. Take advantage of events!)
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Level 210-220</li>
                        <li>
                            Either moderately leveled V skills OR moderately leveled boost nodes 
                            (take advantage of being able to stack multiple boost nodes of the same 
                            skills e.g. A/B/C and B/C/A and C/B/A)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            10 stars, Rare or Epic potential Equipment or better, with appropriate 
                            % Stat on each
                        </li>
                        <li>Legendary Emblem and Secondary with 1-2L IED and 1-2L Att/Matt</li>
                        <li>At least one familiar of 15% IED</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        This puts you at a comfortable bossing range for all bosses 3-doors and 
                        below (and depending on your class and comfort and IED), able to do CVell 
                        and equivalent bosses as well as do a struggle Lotus (although not a 
                        smooth/quick one)
